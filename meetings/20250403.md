# Meeting minutes

1. Discussion on Global Meeting Timing
2. Communication and Engagement Strategies
3. @kiaghadi presentation on the activities of Texas Water Development Board (TWDB)
4. @ebrahimhamidi presentation on compound coastal flood models using hybrid meshes

## 1. Discussion on Global Meeting Timing

The meeting times are currently more suitable for Europe and the US, not ideal for participants from Australia and New Zealand.
Ideas to accommodate different time zones are welcome.

## 2. Communication and Engagement Strategies
Current communication through GitHub discussions is encouraged.
Suggestions for other communication channels like Slack were discussed, though not deemed necessary at this point.
Participants are encouraged to voice ideas for improvement in group management and engagement.

## 3. Presentation on Ocean Modelling
Amin kiaghadi, Manager of Coastal Science Program at Texas Water Development Board.
Focused on initiatives for drought and flood modeling in Texas.
Shared challenges in modeling both drought and flood due to Texas's climate variability.
Discussed data and models used, including the development of a new coast-wide 3D Schism model.
Discussion on an all-in-one compound flood model. TELEMAC is probably able to do it all. 

## 4. Discussion on Compound Flood Simulation
Presentation by Ibrahim Hamidi on enhanced compound flood simulation accuracy using modified digital elevation models.
Emphasized the importance of DM modification in urbanized coastal areas for accurate flood modeling.
Discussed the balance between computational efficiency and model accuracy.
Encouraged the use of hybrid mesh for operational models to reduce computational time.

## Next Steps:

 * Gather feedback on meeting times and communication strategies.
 * Share presentation materials and related publications with attendees.
 * Plan the next meeting with a focus on a single presentation for detailed discussion (Eventual presentation from Ali S)
